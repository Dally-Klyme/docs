While the Klyme Widget shines as an embedded solution — giving you full control over the checkout experience, our Hosted Checkout page offers
the fastest and simplest way to get started.

## How does it work?

1. Call the [`Create Payment Authorisation`](api-reference/endpoint/create) endpoint to initiate a payment authorisation request and receive a unique `uuid`
2. Redirect the customer to https://checkout.klyme.io?uuid={uuid} where `{uuid}` is the value of the `uuid` from Step 1

<Tip>Klyme will handle the entire payment flow from here.</Tip>

<Note>Each Hosted Checkout page is accessible only once for every unique `uuid` generated. Subsequent visits will automatically redirect the customer to the original referring URL.</Note>

### Sandbox

When testing in our sandbox environment, be sure to include the `mode` query parameter and set its value to `test`.

**Example:**

> https://checkout.klyme.io?uuid={uuid}&mode=test

### Language

The `lang` query parameter is optional but can be used to preload the Klyme Widget with a specific language pre-selected by default.

Options available are: `en` `de` `es` `fi` `fr` `it` `nl` `pt` `se`

**Example:**

> https://checkout.klyme.io?uuid={uuid}&lang=fr

### Country (EUR Only)

The `country` parameter is also optional but can be used to preload the Klyme Widget with banks from a specific region as opposed to displaying the entire European banks list.

Alternatively, you can simply pass through `auto` as the `country` parameter and let the Klyme Widget handle everything — automatically detecting the user’s location and displaying region-specific banks.

Options available are: `be` `es` `fr` `it` `nl` `pt` `auto`

**Example:**

> https://checkout.klyme.io?uuid={uuid}&country=auto

<Tip>When using the `lang` or `country` parameters, the user will always have the option to override this and select a langauge or country of their preference.</Tip>
