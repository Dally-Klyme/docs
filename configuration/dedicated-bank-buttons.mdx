Dedicated bank buttons can be created and linked directly to their corresponding banks by 
specifify a `bankId` when making the `/payment-auth-requests` call.

Instead of a `uuid` being returned, an `authId` will be returned.

Redirecting the user to the `authUrl` will either open their mobile banking app or launch their online banking platform in the browser,
depending on the device being used.
