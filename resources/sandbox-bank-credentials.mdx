We have curated a selection of sandbox banks for testing purposes. Please note that these environments are maintained by third-party providers
and may occasionally experience issues.

From our observations, **Modelo Sandbox** has proven to be the most reliable sandbox environment. While it only supports test payments in GBP, its payment flow is identical
to that of other European banks.

<Note>Transactional data in sandboxes might not behave as they would in live banks. For example, payments may transition to `COMPLETED` immediately,
transactions might be identical, transactions may not change their status, and so on.</Note>
